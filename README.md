# Neural Network Self-Driving Car

# Overview
The Neural Network Self-Driving Car project is a simulation utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js to emulate a self-driving car's navigation in a virtual environment. Leveraging neural network technologies, this project enables users to witness the car's autonomous navigation through complex scenarios while avoiding obstacles.

# Project Highlights
- Optimized a neural network-based control model resulting in a 30% reduction in navigation errors within intricate scenarios.
- Collaboratively quantified and interpreted physics-based models, implementing a robust CI/CD workflow that improved the car's data processing time by 15%.

# Key Functionalities
- Autonomous Navigation: Users observe the self-driving car navigating through a simulated environment, autonomously avoiding obstacles like road borders and traffic.
- Control Modes: Users can switch between control modes, allowing manual input or AI-driven decisions to control the car's behavior.

# Project Description:
- User Interaction:
The project offers a simulated environment where users witness a self-driving car navigating through obstacles autonomously, driven by neural network technologies.

- Technology Stack:
  - HTML: Provides the structure and layout for rendering the car and sensor visuals.
  - CSS: Styles the car's visual representation and layout components.
  - JavaScript: Orchestrates the core functionality, managing interactions between different components such as Car.js for car logic, Controls.js for user input, and sensor.js for simulated sensor data.

- Working Process
  - Situation: Utilizes a neural network to drive decisions for the self-driving car.
  - Task: Trains the neural network to process inputs from simulated sensors, detecting distances and angles to obstacles.
  - Action: Adjusts the neural network's weights during training using predefined inputs and outputs, allowing the network to process real-time sensor readings and output control signals for the car.
  - Result: The self-driving car dynamically responds to its environment based on learned patterns, adjusting speed and steering to navigate through the simulated space.

# Achievements
The project integrates control components, collision detection, and visualization components to create an immersive simulation of a self-driving car. With a focus on neural network-driven decision-making, it delivers a realistic experience of autonomous navigation through complex scenarios.
